# Generative AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on projects and demos built with **Generative AI** models (LLMs, image generation, RAG, agents, etc.).  
It’s designed as a learning playground for experimenting with modern generative‑AI tools and workflows.

## 📚 Project overview

Each project folder typically includes:
- A focused use case (e.g. chatbot, document Q&A, code assistant, image generator).
- A minimal but production‑like pipeline (prompting, retrieval‑augmented workflows, or fine‑tuning).
- Simple instructions so you can run, modify, and extend the code.

Current (or planned) topics may include:
- Text‑based LLM apps (chat, summarization, question‑answering).
- Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) over documents.
- AI agents and multi‑step workflows.
- Image‑based or multimodal experiments (if included in your repo).
